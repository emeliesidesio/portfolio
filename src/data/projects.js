    description: "In this group assignment we were asked to create a traditional christmas advent calendar. The calendar should contain 24 days behind which a cookie recipe would be revelead. Each recipe page should have it's own CSS styling. It was also important that the visitor was not able to skip ahead and peek on a day in the future. Only the current day and days in the past should be possible to open. The rest of them should be locked. Since we didn't have a lot of time for this assignment we decided in the group to divide most of the work between us. I came up with the design, structured the landing page and made sure that it was responsive. We divided the styling for the 24 cookie recipes equally between us."
