    description: "In this group assignment we were asked to create a traditional christmas advent calendar. The calendar should contain 24 days behind which a cookie recipe would be revelead. Each recipe page should have it's own CSS styling. It was also important that the visitor was not able to skip ahead and peek on a day in the future. Only the current day and days in the past should be possible to open. The rest of them should be locked. Since we didn't have a lot of time for this assignment we decided in the group to divide most of the work between us. I came up with the design, structured the landing page and made sure that it was responsive. We divided the styling for the 24 cookie recipes equally between us."

We got help from Tictail and built the store using their API's. The site should also be responsive. In our group we decided early on that we wanted to work on all parts together and do a lot of pair programming. We wanted everyone to be involved and understand the different functions and components. We only divided work that we already knew how to do, like CSS styling and structure, and then we worked together on the parts that were new to us."
